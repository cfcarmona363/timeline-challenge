# Timeline challenge

I spent over 9 hours on this project, the most challenging part was designing the data structure and grid architecture to show the information correctly. After that, it got easier and I mainly worked on the following functionalities:

- Create a new event
- Edit an existing event
- Remove an existing event
- Improve de design and UX
- Data validation

I started the project with Vite and a React template. To run the project please follow these steps:

- Clone the repository
- Move to the project main directory
- Run `yarn install`
- Run `yarn run dev`
- Access the project here http://localhost:5173/
